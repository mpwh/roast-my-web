| 5 × early bird | 5 | $49 | $245 |
| 7 × standard | 7 | $79 | $553 |
| 2 × inferno | 2 | $149 | $298 |
| **Total** | **14** | | **$1,096** |

## 🔄 Viral Loop Strategy

### The Core Loop
```
Free Mini Roast → "OMG this is so good" → Share screenshot → Friends see it → They want one too
```

### Specific Viral Mechanics

1. **Shareable Roast Cards**
   - Create a branded "roast score card" image for each client (Overall: 4.2/10 🔥)
   - Client shares it on Twitter: "Just got roasted by @pandu. I scored 4/10 💀"
   - Include your URL watermark on the card

2. **"Roast Me" Challenge**
   - Encourage founders to publicly ask for a roast: "Hey @pandu, roast my site!"
   - Do a quick 2-tweet roast publicly → DM full version
   - Others see the thread → want their own roast

3. **Referral Incentive**
   - "Refer a friend → get a free page added to your roast"
   - Or: "Refer 2 friends → get a follow-up check-in call free"

4. **Public Roast Series**
   - Weekly Twitter Spaces: "Live Roast Friday" — roast 2-3 sites live
   - Record and clip for content
   - Viewers want to be next → convert to paid

5. **Leaderboard / Hall of Fame**
   - "Best scoring sites" and "Most improved" on the landing page
   - Gamifies it → founders share to show off their score

### Shareability Checklist
- [ ] Add "Share your roast" button to delivery email
- [ ] Create Twitter-optimized roast score card template (Canva)
- [ ] Add referral link tracking (simple UTM params)
- [ ] Include tweetable one-liners in every roast report

## 📝 Outreach Templates

### Cold DM — Twitter (for founders who just launched)
```
Hey [name]! Congrats on launching [product]. 

Quick thought — your hero section says "[their headline]" but I wasn't sure what it does in the first 5 seconds. 

I do $79 website roasts (video + written report) — would love to give yours the full treatment. First 5 customers get it for $49.

No pressure either way — just thought you'd find it useful! 🔥
```

### Cold DM — LinkedIn (for startup founders)
```
Hi [name], saw [company] — love the concept.

I noticed a few quick UX wins on your landing page that could boost conversions. I run a micro-service called Roast My Website — 15-min video roast + written report with actionable fixes.

Would you be open to getting your site roasted? Happy to share a sample first.
```

### Reply to "just launched" posts (Reddit/IH)
```
Congrats on the launch! Quick feedback on your landing page:

🔥 Your headline is about features, not outcomes — try leading with the problem you solve
🔥 I see 3 different CTAs above the fold — pick one primary action
🔥 No social proof visible — even "Used by 10 beta testers" helps

These are just surface-level. I do full $79 roasts (video + report) if you want the deep dive. Happy to answer questions!
```

### Tweet templates
```
🔥 Just roasted [X] websites this week.

The #1 conversion killer?

Your value prop takes too long to understand.

If I can't explain what you do in 5 seconds, your visitors can't either.

(DM me "ROAST" for yours — $79, 24hr delivery)
```

```
I'll roast your website for free. Right here. Right now.

Drop your URL below 👇

(I'll give you 1-2 quick hits. For the full 15-min video + report, it's $79)
```

```
Stop asking your friends for website feedback.

They'll say "looks great!" because they don't want to hurt your feelings.

You need someone who doesn't care about your feelings.

You need a roast. 🔥

DM me.
```

## 🔄 Free Roast → Paid Conversion Strategy

### The "Taste Test" Method
1. **Free mini roast** = 3 bullet points (takes you 5 min to produce)
   - "Your headline is about you, not your customer"
   - "Your CTA says 'Learn More' — that's the weakest CTA possible"
   - "No social proof above the fold — visitors don't trust you yet"
2. **End with:** "These are just the surface issues. The full roast covers 8 areas with video walkthrough and specific fixes. Want in?"
3. **Scarcity:** "I'm only doing 15 full roasts this week at $79"

### Conversion Levers
- **Specificity:** The mini roast proves you actually looked at THEIR site
- **Pain amplification:** "These 3 things alone could be costing you 20-40% of conversions"
- **Social proof:** "Here's what [previous client] said after implementing the fixes"
- **Time pressure:** "Price goes to $99 next week"
- **Risk reversal:** "If you don't find at least 3 actionable fixes, I'll refund you"

### Email Sequence for Free Leads
```
Email 1 (immediate): "Your mini roast is ready" + 3 bullet points + CTA to full roast
Email 2 (24hrs later): "The #1 thing killing your conversions" (deeper insight) + CTA
Email 3 (48hrs later): "Last chance at $49" (if launch week) or "$79 before price increase"
```
