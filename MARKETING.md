# Marketing Copy - Roast My Website

## 🔥 LinkedIn Post (Provocative Style)

### Version 1: The Money Hook

Your website is losing you money.

I know because I've seen the pattern 100+ times:

❌ You're getting traffic but no conversions
❌ Your bounce rate is embarrassing  
❌ You "think" your CTA is clear (it's not)
❌ You're guessing what's wrong instead of knowing

Here's the brutal truth most designers won't tell you:

→ Your hero section confuses people
→ Your value prop requires a PhD to understand
→ Your mobile site is a dumpster fire
→ You have 4 CTAs when you need 1
→ Your page loads slower than a 1998 Geocities site

I'm Pandu, a Technical PM who lives at the intersection of UX, product, and conversion.

I've shipped products people love. I've also seen products tank because of easily fixable UX fails.

**New service: I'll roast your website for $79**

What you get:
• 15-min video walkthrough (me using your site like a real visitor)
• Written report with screenshots and specific fixes
• Top 3 quick wins you can implement TODAY
• Strategic improvements for long-term growth
• 24-48hr delivery

Not your typical "great job, very nice!" feedback.

This is the constructively honest roast you NEED to hear.

Limited to 15 roasts this week.

Comment "ROAST" and I'll DM you the link.

Or grab your spot: [GUMROAD LINK]

P.S. — One extra signup per month pays for this. You'll get way more than one.

### Version 2: The Confrontation Hook

I just spent 10 seconds on your landing page.

I still don't know what you do.

If I'm confused, your visitors are gone.

And that's money walking away.

The worst part? You probably have NO idea which part of your site is bleeding conversions.

Is it your headline? Your CTA? Your load time? Your mobile layout? Your value prop?

**You're guessing. And guessing is expensive.**

I'm launching a micro-service: Roast My Website - $79

I'll analyze your site like a first-time visitor and tell you EXACTLY what's broken:

🔥 Why your hero section isn't working
🔥 Why nobody clicks your CTA  
🔥 Why your mobile experience sucks
🔥 Why you're not building trust
🔥 What to fix first for maximum impact

You get:
• 15-min screen recording (video roast)
• Written report with screenshots
• Top 3 quick wins
• Top 3 strategic improvements
• Delivered in 24-48 hours

This isn't nice feedback. This is the truth.

The kind of feedback that makes you go "oh SHIT, he's right."

Because I'm not here to make you feel good. I'm here to make you money.

15 spots this week. After that, price goes up.

## 🧵 X/Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1:**
Your website is losing you money.

You're getting traffic. But no conversions.

Here's why (and how to fix it):

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Problem #1: Your headline is about YOU, not your customer

"We're an AI-powered cloud-native SaaS platform..."

Nobody cares what you ARE. They care what you DO FOR THEM.

Fix: Lead with the outcome.
"Cut your support tickets in half"

**Tweet 3:**
Problem #2: You have 4 different CTAs above the fold

"Sign up" "Start free trial" "Book a demo" "Learn more"

Which one should I click?

(Spoiler: I won't click any. Too much choice = paralysis)

Fix: ONE primary CTA. Everything else is secondary.

**Tweet 4:**
Problem #3: Your mobile site is a disaster

• Text too small to read
• Buttons too close to tap
• Loads in 7 seconds
• Horizontal scroll (!?)

Half your traffic is mobile. Half your revenue is walking away.

Fix: Test on an actual phone. Not desktop DevTools.

**Tweet 5:**
Problem #4: Zero trust signals

No testimonials. No social proof. No credibility markers.

Just "trust me bro" energy.

Why should I give you my email/money when you look like a weekend project?

Fix: Add real testimonials, logos, stats, guarantees.

**Tweet 6:**
Problem #5: Your value prop is vague AF

I spent 10 seconds on your site. I still don't know:
• What you do
• Who it's for  
• Why I should care

If I'm confused, I'm gone.

Fix: One clear sentence. What you do + who for + benefit.

**Tweet 7:**
These aren't hypotheticals.

These are REAL issues I see on 90% of indie hacker sites.

And they're costing you conversions.

**Tweet 8:**
So I'm launching a new service:

Roast My Website - $79

I'll analyze your site like a first-time visitor and give you:
• 15-min video roast
• Written report
• Top 3 quick wins
• Strategic improvements
• 24-48hr delivery

Not nice feedback. The TRUTH.

**Tweet 9:**
Think of it this way:

One extra customer pays for this.

And you'll get way more than one.

Limited to 15 roasts this week.

Grab your spot: [LINK]

Or reply "ROAST" and I'll DM you.

## 💼 Indie Hackers Community Post

### Title:
I'm launching "Roast My Website" – $79 for brutally honest UX feedback [Looking for first 10 customers]

### Post Body:

Hey IH! 👋

I'm Pandu, a Technical PM who's been lurking here for years.

**TL;DR:** I'm launching a micro-service where I roast your landing page and tell you exactly what's killing your conversions. $79, delivered in 24-48 hours. Looking for my first 10 customers this week.

---

**The backstory:**

I've been DMing founders here for months, giving free feedback on their landing pages.

The pattern is always the same:

"Wow, I had NO idea that was confusing"  
"This is gold, can I pay you?"  
"I changed X and conversions went up 40%"

So I'm packaging it into a service.

**What you get:**

🎥 15-min video where I use your site like a first-time visitor  
📄 Written report with screenshots & specific fixes  
⚡ Top 3 quick wins (implement today, see results tomorrow)  
🎯 Top 3 strategic improvements (long-term conversion growth)

**What I analyze:**

• First impression (the 5-second test)
• Hero section & value prop
• CTA effectiveness  
• Trust signals
• Mobile experience
• Page speed
• SEO basics

**Who this is for:**

If you're getting traffic but not conversions, this is for you.

If your bounce rate makes you cry, this is for you.

If you're guessing what's broken instead of *knowing*, this is for you.

**The style:**

Constructively honest. Not mean, but not sugar-coated.

I'll tell you the truth. The kind of feedback your friends are too nice to give you.

**Pricing:**

$79. One-time.

(Considering raising it to $99-149 after the first 10, so jump in now)

**Why I'm doing this:**

1. I genuinely love helping founders convert better
2. I'm testing if this is a viable side income stream
3. I want to hit $1K this week from 10-15 roasts

**What I need from you:**

1. Your landing page URL
2. Any specific concerns (optional)
3. 24-48 hours

**Interested?**

Comment below or DM me. I'll send you the Gumroad link.

First 10 people get priority delivery.

**P.S.** — I'll share a sample roast in the comments so you can see the quality.

### r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Turned my free DMs into a $79 micro-service – "Roast My Website"

**Post:**

For the past few months, I've been giving free website feedback to founders in DMs.

The response was always: "This is gold, can I pay you?"

So I packaged it into a service: **Roast My Website**

**The offer:**

$79 for a brutally honest UX roast of your landing page.

You get:
- 15-min video walkthrough
- Written report with screenshots
- Top 3 quick wins
- Strategic improvements
- 24-48hr delivery

**What I analyze:**
- First impression & value prop clarity
- Hero section & CTA effectiveness
- Trust signals & social proof
- Mobile experience
- Page speed
- SEO basics

**The style:**

Constructively honest. I'm not here to pat you on the back. I'm here to show you what's broken and how to fix it.

**Why this works:**

Most founders are too close to their product. They can't see what's confusing to first-time visitors.

I've seen the same patterns kill conversions over and over:
- Vague value props
- Too many CTAs
- No trust signals
- Terrible mobile experience
- Jargon-heavy copy

These are EASY to fix if you know what to look for.

**My goal:**

10-15 roasts this week = $1K

Then scale from there.

**What I'm testing:**
- Is $79 the right price?
- Can I deliver quality at this speed?
- Is there demand for this?

**Feedback welcome:**

Landing page: [LINK]

Would you buy this? What would make you buy? What's missing?

And if you want your site roasted, comment or DM me.
